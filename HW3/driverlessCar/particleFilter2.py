    # Problem 4 (part a): 
    # Function: Observe:
    # -----------------
    # Takes |self.particles| and updates them based on the distance observation
    # $d_t$ and your position $a_t$. 
    # This algorithm takes two steps:
    # 1. Reweight the particles based on the observation.
    #    Concept: We had an old distribution of particles, we want to update these
    #             these particle distributions with the given observed distance by
    #             the emission probability. 
    #             Think of the particle distribution as the unnormalized posterior 
    #             probability where many tiles would have 0 probability.
    #             Tiles with 0 probabilities (no particles), we do not need to update. 
    #             This makes particle filtering runtime to be O(|particles|).
    #             In comparison, exact inference (problem 2 + 3), most tiles would
    #             would have non-zero probabilities (though can be very small). 
    # 2. Resample the particles.
    #    Concept: Now we have the reweighted (unnormalized) distribution, we can now 
    #             resample the particles and update where each particle should be at.
    #
    # - agentX: x location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - agentY: y location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - observedDist: true distance plus a mean-zero Gaussian with standard deviation Const.SONAR_STD
    #
    # Notes:
    # - Create |self.NUM_PARTICLES| new particles during resampling.
    # - To pass the grader, you must call util.weightedRandomChoice() once per new particle.

    # ---------------------

    # |self.particles| corresponding to time $t+1$.
    # This algorithm takes one step
    # 1. Proposal based on the particle distribution at current time $t$:
    #    Concept: We have particle distribution at current time $t$, we want to
    #             propose the particle distribution at time $t+1$. We would like
    #             to sample again to see where each particle would end up using
    #             the transition model.
    #
    # Notes:
    # - transition probabilities is now using |self.transProbDict|
    # - Use util.weightedRandomChoice() to sample a new particle.
    # - To pass the grader, you must loop over the particles using
    #       for tile in self.particles
    #   and call util.weightedRandomChoice() $once per particle$ on the tile.
